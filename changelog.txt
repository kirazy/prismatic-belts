Version: 2.0.0
Date: 2024-10-27
  Features:
    - Added support for Factorio: Space Age!
      - Requires supplementary asset mod Prismatic Belts: Space Age. An error will be raised if the mod is not present when Space Age is enabled
  Changes:
    - The API has been reworked:
      - Mod authors should now require the API with `require("__prismatic-belts__.prototypes.api")`
      - Added `get_transport_belt_frozen_patch`, taking either 1, 2, or 3 as an input to get the Space Age `frozen_patch` for transport belts. Returns `nil` if Space Age is not enabled
      - Functions `get_transport_belt_animation_set` and `create_remnant` `inputs` structures now have additional properties:
        - `tint_base_as_overlay` (suggested true)
        - `tint_mask_as_overlay` (suggested true)
        - `arrow_tint` (Color); Adds an extra layer to raise the brightness of arrows when working with a darker `mask_tint` when defined, otherwise does nothing.
      - Function `create_remnant` now supports variants; 3 requires Space Age
      - Functions `get_transport_belt_icon` and `get_transport_belt_technology_icon` `inputs` structures now have additional properties:
        - `arrow_tint` (Color); Adds an extra layer to raise the brightness of arrows when working with a darker `mask_tint` when defined, otherwise does nothing. It is suggested to use low gray values and an alpha value of 0
    - Factorio Library has been removed as a dependency
  Breaking Changes:
    - The Prismatic Belt global function host `prismatic_belts` has been removed
    - The API has been reworked:
      - `adjust_alpha` has been removed
      - `transport_belt_picture` has been removed
      - `logistics_technology_icon` has been renamed to `get_transport_belt_technology_icon`
        - The `inputs` structure has been revised:
          - `use_reskin_process` has been removed
          - `arrow_tint` (a Color type) has been added; when omitted, the extra "arrow" layer is not added to the icon. Use to raise the brightness of arrows when working with a darker `mask_tint`.
      - `transport_belt_icon` has been renamed to `get_transport_belt_icon`, and the inputs have been reworked into a single `inputs` structure
      - `transport_belt_animation_set` has been renamed to `get_transport_belt_animation_set`
        - The `inputs` structure has been revised:
          - `use_reskin_process` has been removed
          - `brighten_arrows` (boolean) has been replaced with `arrow_tint` (Color); suggested tints are e.g. `util.color("5")
      - `create_remnant` `inputs` structure has been revised:
        - `use_reskin_process` has been removed
        - `brighten_arrows` (boolean) has been replaced with `arrow_tint` (Color); suggested tints are e.g. `util.color("5")
